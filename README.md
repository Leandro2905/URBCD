# UWBCD-REACTOS
Ultimate Windows Boot CD with ReactOS

Based on the Ultimate Boot CD (UBCD) http://www.ultimatebootcd.com/ and ReactOS https://www.reactos.org/.

Goal is to create a Boot CD (All-in-one-Solution) for system repair that is based on a Windows-compatible OS (ReactOS) and is a replacment for the abandoned Ultimate Boot CD 4 Windows (UBCD4Win) and the abandoned Hiren's Boot CD. The Boot CD should be feature equal.

Maybe we make different versions with different sizes...

We will only use software under the license OpenSource, FreeWare, ShareWare & TrailWare.

To-Dos:
- Virtual-Machine-Image (VM) (with: https://www.virtualbox.org/) as Development Environment to test ReactOS and the Software that should be included in the Boot CD
- Maybe 'sort-out' the underlying UBCD to get UWBCD on a CD (650MB-Limit)
- Make the CD feature equal to the Ultimate Boot CD 4 Windows
- Make the CD feature equal to Hiren's Boot CD
- Branding
- Artwork
