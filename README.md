**Ultimate Windows Boot CD with ReactOS**

Based on the [Ultimate Boot CD (UBCD)](https://github.com/UWBCD/UWBCD-ReactOS/wiki/UBCD) and [ReactOS](https://www.reactos.org/).

Goal is to create a free (and mostly Open-Source) Boot CD (All-in-One-Solution) for system repair & maintenance that is based on ReactOS (a Windows-compatible OS) and is a replacement for the discontinued Ultimate Boot CD 4 Windows (UBCD4Win). The Boot CD should make UBCD4Win and similar Boot CDs unnecessary.  

More to the discontinued UBCD4Win can you read [here](https://github.com/UWBCD/UWBCD-ReactOS/wiki/Software-List-3:-UBCD4Win).  

Also there existed the Hiren's Boot CD. We will use this CD too as a reference.  
More to the Hiren's Boot CD can you read [here](https://github.com/UWBCD/UWBCD-ReactOS/wiki/Software-List-4:-Hiren's).  

We are also working on a own list with new software that can/should be included.  
For more informations look please look [here](https://github.com/UWBCD/UWBCD-ReactOS/wiki/Software-List-1:-Our-own).  

For more about our goals please read [this](https://github.com/UWBCD/UWBCD-ReactOS/wiki/1.)-Project-Goals).  

There is still a lot to do... [Here](https://github.com/UWBCD/UWBCD-ReactOS/wiki/To-Dos) is our To-Dos-List!
