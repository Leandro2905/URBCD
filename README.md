# URBCD - **Ultimate ReactOS Boot CD**

Based on the [Ultimate Boot CD (UBCD)](https://github.com/UWBCD/UWBCD-ReactOS/wiki/UBCD) and [ReactOS](https://www.reactos.org/).

Goal is to create a free (and mostly Open-Source) Boot CD (All-in-One-Solution) for system repair & maintenance that is based on ReactOS (a Windows-compatible OS) and is a replacement for the discontinued Ultimate Boot CD 4 Windows (UBCD4Win). The Boot CD should make UBCD4Win and similar Boot CDs unnecessary.

More to the discontinued UBCD4Win can you read [here](https://github.com/UWBCD/UWBCD-ReactOS/wiki/Software-List-3:-UBCD4Win).  

Also there existed the Hiren's Boot CD. We will use this CD too as a reference.  
More to the Hiren's Boot CD can you read [here](https://github.com/UWBCD/UWBCD-ReactOS/wiki/Software-List-4:-Hiren's).  

We are also working on a own list with new software that can/should be included.  
For more informations look please look [here](https://github.com/UWBCD/UWBCD-ReactOS/wiki/Software-List-1:-Our-own).
