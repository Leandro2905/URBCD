Ultimate Windows Boot CD with ReactOS

Forum: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/uwbcd

Based on the Ultimate Boot CD (UBCD) http://www.ultimatebootcd.com/ and ReactOS https://www.reactos.org/.

Goal is to create a free Boot CD (All-in-one-Solution) for system repair that is based on a Windows-compatible OS (ReactOS) and is a replacement for the discontinued Ultimate Boot CD 4 Windows (UBCD4Win). The Boot CD should be feature equal.

Also there existed the original Hiren's Boot CD. We will use this CD too as a reference.
