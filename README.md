# UWBCD-REACTOS
Ultimate Windows Boot CD with ReactOS

Forum: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/uwbcd

Based on the Ultimate Boot CD (UBCD) http://www.ultimatebootcd.com/ and ReactOS https://www.reactos.org/.

Goal is to create a free Boot CD (All-in-one-Solution) for system repair that is based on a Windows-compatible OS (ReactOS) and is a replacment for the discontinued Ultimate Boot CD 4 Windows (UBCD4Win). The Boot CD should be feature equal.  
More to the discontinued UBCD4Win: https://github.com/UWBCD/UWBCD-REACTOS/wiki/Software-List:-UBCD4Win  
Also there existed the original Hiren's Boot CD. We will use this CD too as a reference.

We are also working on a own list with new software that can be included.  
For more informations look here: https://github.com/UWBCD/UWBCD-REACTOS/wiki/Software-List:-Our-own  
Maybe we make different versions with different sizes...  

To-Dos:
- Virtual-Machine-Image (VM) (with: https://www.virtualbox.org/) as Development Environment to test ReactOS and the Software that should be included in the Boot CD
- Maybe 'sort-out' the underlying UBCD to get UWBCD on a CD (650MB-Limit)
- Make the CD feature equal to the Ultimate Boot CD 4 Windows
- Make the CD feature equal to Hiren's Boot CD
- Better including of ReactOS into the UBCD
- Branding
- Artwork

What we don't want to include:
- Warez - we will only use software under the license OpenSource, FreeWare, ShareWare & TrailWare
- Software, were special Boot CDs already exist

If you want to use also a software were a Boot CD exist for (e.g. Antivirus Solution), then you can have a llok at this Guide about making a Multiboot-USB-Stick: https://github.com/LV-Crew/Multiboot-USB-Stick
